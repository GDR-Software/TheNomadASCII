# The Nomad ASCII/Text-Based Roleplaying Game
Hey there. Now, you might be wondering: "WTF Is This?"
That question is kinda answered: This is a project currently in the works. A heavily toned down version of another 3d game that I'm currently working on in Unreal 5.

The Nomad is a futuristic, gruesome story of the horrors of the wasteland that many people call home.

Until my own license has been completed, this project will be using the GNU General Public License.

Until I have completed the entire game, this project will be written primarily for linux OS. Then I plan to make it compatible with Windows x86/x64. But until then. it's only linux compatible, so sorry about that.

I'll be updating this game constantly. But thanks anyway for checking it out or even stumbling upon it.

Your Resident Fiend,
