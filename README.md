# The Nomad ASCII/Text-Based Roleplaying Game
Hey there. Now, you might be wondering: "WTF Is This?"
That question is kinda answered: This is a project currently in the works. A heavily toned down version of another 3d game that I'm currently working on in Unreal 5.

The Nomad is a futuristic, gruesome story of the horrors of the wasteland that many people call home.

Until my own license has been completed, this project will be using the GNU General Public License.

Until I have completed the entire game, this project will be written primarily for linux OS. Then I plan to make it compatible with Windows x86/x64. But until then. it's only linux compatible, so sorry about that.

I'll be updating this game constantly. But thanks anyway for checking it out or even stumbling upon it.

Your Resident Fiend,

## About the Game Engine (SACE)
There is currently a branch apart from main called "SACE", that is where I have committed the very much incomplete engine. So now for the _About the Game Engine_ part. SACE stands for SIGAAMDAD's ASCII Console Engine: S.A.C.E

Now the engine is nowhere near complete, and I advise you don't even look at it right now. And all the information I have for right now is that until the ASCII engine is completed, I will be doing all that hard shit myself in this game's source code. So Until Then...
