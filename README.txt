The Nomad (ASCII) is a game that attempts to bend the limitations of a command-prompt game. Sure, it's only really got text-based graphics, somewhat decent text-based animations, and a very toned down gameplay style compared to what we're used to with modern games. But that's a part of the charm. The Nomad (ASCII) is meant to be a game that can be played in any sort of way. It's meant to be moddable and fucked with to the point of insanity, and that's the point. This repo is slapped here as part of your enjoyment, so that you may customize this game to fit your playstyle however you may like.

About the game asides. The source is split up into 2 (soon to be 4) sections, any file with g_ is a file that'll run with the entire game. And any file with c_ is a file specific to the campaign, whether it be the pre-written story or the AI story.

The annoying part about the code is that it'll only compile on Windows and Linux. But it's mostly optimized for linux terminals. So if you're a windows user, then you'll have a bit less functionality and a smidgen less performance.

Now, you might be asking: "Why not write this game in C?". The answer is simply, C++ is a better language for performance and game development. It has 10x the amount of functionality than C. Although, C lovers, don't get too sad, because about 10-15% of this game is written in C, meaning it's a .c file.

But anyhow. I hope you enjoy what has taken myself and a few other's countless hours to create. This game is written in a way to best suite moddability, or I dear hope so...

Your Resident Fiend,
