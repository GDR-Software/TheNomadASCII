So, here it is, finally. The Nomad (ASCII) is a game that's been in development for a staggering amount of time. Most of that being because it was a massive solo project at the beginning. This game's design is for moddability and the ideal of being able to be run literally anywhere that has a text display. Now, you might not get any audio, but that's a luxury you can only really get on a pc source port.

This repo contains many different things within it, so here's a simple summary of how to use it: If you want to run the game in a sort of specialized development mode, you'll have to run "./dev.bash" along with some parameters. To run the game in debug mode, use "./dev.bash build debug", to run the game in test mode (if you want to load up a custom feature or something like that, or maybe even the alpha/beta versions), use "./dev.bash build testbuild". Now, if you want to run the game normally, then use "./dev.bash run main", but if you want to run the build-in map-maker/editor, use "./dev.bash run mapmaker" (you can only run the game with command-line parameters).

The moddability of this game is done to the extent that there's a dedicated file extension (.bff, stands for "BIG FUCKING FILE")  for the maps used by the engine. The .bff file isn't actually anything more than a fancy and glorified basic-text file. The map-maker/editor written into the dev mode can save user-made maps to a .bff format without you having to hardcode them yourself (because that's what we had to do when we hadn't implemented the map-maker yet), although it doesn't auto-save, so forewarning. The map-maker workd a lot like the 1993 DOOM one (the modern source-port map editors that is). But it's all text-based

You might be wondering why on earth this game is only text-based. The simple answer is, well, that's part of the charm. Before powerful computers had been made, Moria, Rogue, and Angband were really the only options if you wanted a story-filled, immersive, and action-packed video-game. Now, The Nomad (ASCII) isn't really like those games, being much more of an attempt to be more 3d (but not really).

FYI: This Is Still A Non-Functional Game, Do Not Clone Or Download!!!!!!!!!!!!!
